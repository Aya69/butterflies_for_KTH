# butterflies_for_KTH
Flying butterflies WebGL project for DH2323 course 


In this project an attempt is made to create a graphical animating scene where butterflies are flying around flowers. Implementation is going to be in pure Javascript with WebGL inserts, without using any third party libraries like Three.JS or anything alike. Butterflies' movement is calculated in Javascript and WebGL basically functions as a renderer for butterflies, flowers and background. WebGL capabilities are utilized to create some appealing visual effects in the scene. The idea is to create a beautiful animated scene and learn how to use WebGL in combination with Javascript.
